  @section {Using the autotools}
    QtLua can be built using the autotools based build system. This is
    the preferred approach on @em GNU/Linux systems:
    @code R
./configure
make
    @end code

    This will build the library, the @tt qtlua tool and all example
    applications.

    Depending on your lua version and installation path, the configure
    script may not find lua header files or library files. Passing
    additional options to the configure script will fix this:
    @code R
./configure --with-lua-lib=lua5 --with-lualib-lib=lualib5 \
            --with-lua-inc-dir=/usr/include/lua5
make
    @end code
  @end section

  @section {Using Cmake}
    @url {http://www.cmake.org/} {Cmake} comes as an alternative build
    system and can be used on platforms were the autotools do not
    properly detect Qt. This approach requires Cmake installed on your
    platform.
    @code RS
cmake -G "<cmake generator name>" .
make
    @end code
    This will build the library and the @tt qtlua tool.
