 The QtLua library aims to make Qt4 applications scriptable
 using the @url http://www.lua.org/ {Lua} scripting language. It is an
 alternative to the QtScript module.

 QtLua does not generate or use generated binding code for Qt. Instead it
 provides useful C++ wrapper classes to make C++ and lua objects accessible
 from both lua and C++. It takes advantages of the Qt meta object
 system to expose @ref QObject members to lua scripts.

 QtLua is not designed to develop an application in pure Lua but
 rather to extend a Qt C++ application using Lua as scripting
 language.
