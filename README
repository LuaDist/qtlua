The QtLua library aims to make Qt4 applications scriptable using the
Lua scripting language.

QtLua is released under the GNU LGPL v3 license.

Build and install
=================

The library now comes with two build systems:

  - The main GNU autotools build system which is suited for GNU/Linux:

    cd libqtlua-x.x.x
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    ../configure
    make
    make install

  - The alternative CMake build system which is suited for any
    platform. It needs CMake installed to work:

    cd libqtlua-x.x.x
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
